# HappyHere
HappyHere is a participatory, immersive light installation, created for Pig Rock Bothy, which uses colour and light to visualise thoughts and feelings. 

HappyHere explores the links between art, technology and wellbeing. The installation uses technology, similar to those we use in our everyday lives to measure, record and analyse how we manage our wellbeing and how we feel, such as mobile apps, wearables and social media platforms. The technology turns visitorâ€™s answers to seven simple questions into a narrative of light and colour, featured on a custom-built screen in the installation. After dark, Pig Rock Bothy becomes a beacon of coloured light, replaying all of the feelings recorded by it during the day and transmitting it out into the dark winter sky. 

This installation has been created by Martin Skelly & Pete Thomas from the University of Dundee and was commissioned by National Galleries of Scotland for Pig Rock Bothy.
